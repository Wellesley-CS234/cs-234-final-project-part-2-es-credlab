st.write('''Let's revisit the research questions I set out to answer at the beginning of this analysis:\n''')

st.write('''\t1. Does the gender or occupation of a feminist seemingly influence to their popularity?\n''')
st.write('''As we saw from the analysis on the 'Data Overview' page, occupation does seem to have an influence on a feminist's popularity on Wikipedia. Specifically, writers and authors tend to have higher pageviews compared to feminists in other occupations.
         We also saw that male freminists are very popular on Wikipedia, which may indicate a bias due to Wikipedia editors and their interests.''')

st.write('''\t2. Does a feminist's country of origin seemingly influence their popularity?\n''')
st.write('''As we saw from the analysis on the 'Geographical Analysis' page, country of origin does seem to have an influence on a feminist's popularity on Wikipedia. Specifically, feminists from the United States tend to have higher pageviews compared to feminists from other countries. 
         This trend also extends to feminists from the Western World.''')

st.write('''\t3. Does the wave of feminism that a feminist is associated with seemingly influence their popularity?\n''')
st.write('''As we saw from the anlyses from the 'Feminist Wave Analysis' page, feminists associated with the first and second waves of feminism tend to have higher pageviews compared to feminists associated with the third wave or other waves of feminism.''')

st.write('''\t4. Are feminist scholars and authors more well known than feminist organizers and public figures?\n''')
st.write('''As we saw from the anlyses from the 'Text Classification' page, feminists asasigned to category 1 (scholars and authors) tend to have higher total pageviews compared to feminists assigned to category 2 (organizers and public figures).
         However, feminists in category 2 tend to have a higher average pageviews per article compared to feminists in category 1. Therefore, these categories provide insight into how the 
         nature of a feminist's work may influence their popularity on Wikipedia.''')

st.write('''Overall, this analysis has provided insight into the factors that may influence a feminist's popularity on Wikipedia and the potential biases that Wikipedia editors hold when recording history for the public.
         There may be many other factors that influence a feminist's popularity on Wikipedia that were not explored in this analysis, such as the time period in which the feminist was active or the specific topics they wrote about. However, this 
         analysis opens the door for further exploration into the representation of feminists on Wikipedia and how this representation may shape public perception of feminism and its history.''')
